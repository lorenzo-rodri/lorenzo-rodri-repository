  <h1>The Importance of Software Design</h1>
  <p>An example of software that I think was designed well is Google Calendar. It is a simple calendar app but there are
    many convenient features that go above and beyond to make planning your life easier.</p>
  <p>Visual aspects of software, especially in productivity apps, are fundamental. Their purpose is to improve your life,
    but to do that, they need to be easy to navigate, and easy on the eyes. The design of the Google Calendar app is functional
    without being too cluttered, with features like colour-coded events, pop-up menus, and search features, it is easier to use 
    the app without being overwhelming. This ensures that there is never too much on the screen at once, but functionality-wise
    everything you need is included. An example of a feature that I think is convenient and really well thought out is the ability
    to add a location to an event such that when it is clicked on, it opens up Google Maps to provide directions. In addition to this,
    it displays an image of the location at the top of the event to give the user another visual aid.</p>
  <p>Software design is so important because it does not matter how good the functionality of your software is, if it is not intuitive
    or easy to navigate, people are not going to want to use it. When designing software, it is important to keep in mind that although
    you as the creator might understand how it works, the user does not. This is why things like labels, titles, headings, images, icons,
    descriptions, and many other design aspects are essential to an effective piece of software.</p>
  <h1>The Requirements Gathering Stage</h1>
  <p>The requirements-gathering stage is an important part of the software development process. This stage is essential to ensure that 
    the software product delivered meets the client's functional requirements, such as a function the system should execute, and 
    non-functional requirements, like potential constraints, data types that will be used, and how the software should perform functions. 
    Requirements are primarily gathered through interviews with the client where the developer will have a conversation with a 
    stakeholder to understand the user needs.</p>
  <p>A common format that is used in these interviews and in requirements gathering in general is user stories, which provide a concise
    description of a function that needs to be included, written from the perspective of the user. It should include who will be using the 
    function, what action should be performed, and why it needs to be performed. Additional methods of requirement gathering include 
    surveys, brainstorming sessions, observation, and study documentation.</p>
  <h1>User Stories</h1>
  <p>1. As a user, I want to be able to add a location to an event, so that I can find directions when the event occurs.
    2. As a business, I want to be able to share calendar events with employees, so that I can efficiently share an event or meeting's time, location, and date.
    3. As a user, I want to be able to create repeating events for things like my work schedule, so that I don't have to spend time adding each shift one by one.
    4. As a user, I want to be able to colour-code events, so that they are easier to distinguish.
    5. As a user, I want to be able to sync my calendar across devices, so that I can access it wherever and whenever I need to.</p>
